# NgPathway

`NgPathway` is a file-based router utilities library for Angular applications. It simplifies the process of creating and managing routes in your Angular app by allowing you to organize your routes in a directory structure that mirrors your application's UI structure.

## Features

- File-based routing: `NgPathway` helps to use file-based routing to create clear and concise routes to your data, making it easy to navigate and manage large datasets.
- Optimized data fetching: NgPathway optimizes data fetching to minimize load times and improve performance, ensuring that your applications run smoothly and efficiently.

## Installation

To get started with `NgPathway`, simply install the library using NPM:

```bash
npm install ngpathway --save
```

## Usage

To use `NgPathway`, you will need to create a directory structure that mirrors your application's UI structure. You must create a pages directory inside your main component folder, and the routes will be derived from directory structure (i.e., each component or folder will represent a Route in your application).
